# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

Project Setup

## Project Setup

## 1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/researcher-collaboration-portal.git
Install dependencies:

cd researcher-collaboration-portal
npm install

## 2. Frontend Development (React.js)

The frontend is developed using React.js, where users can interact with the portal.

UI Design and Components: The user interface is designed with reusable components for different sections (e.g., search bar, collaborator requests, chat interface).
State Management: We use React Context API for global state management (or Redux if required).

Routing: We use React Router for navigating between pages like Dashboard, Profile, Announcements, and Messages.
Fetching Data: Frontend communicates with the backend API through RESTful API calls using Axios or Fetch.
Authentication: Authentication is handled via JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user login and session management.
Steps:

Implement UI components for the researcher's profile and announcements.
Set up React Router for different pages: Home, Dashboard, Profile, Messages, and Search.
Use Axios to call backend endpoints for retrieving and sending data.
Integrate the chat functionality for real-time messaging.

## 3. Backend Development (Node.js / Express.js)

The backend handles the logic for user authentication, storing research announcements, and messaging.

API Endpoints: Built with Express.js to handle requests from the frontend.
Authentication: JWT is used for authenticating users and providing secure API access.
Database: Data is stored in a MySQL database, which holds tables like Users, Announcements, Collaborator Requests, Messages, etc.
Real-Time Communication: Socket.io is used for implementing real-time messaging and notifications.
Error Handling: Standard error handling mechanisms are implemented for API responses (e.g., 400, 404, 500 errors).
Security: Protect sensitive data using encryption (e.g., bcrypt for passwords) and implement security measures (e.g., CORS, rate-limiting).
Steps:

Set up Express.js and create endpoints for user registration, login, profile management, posting announcements, and managing collaborator requests.
Implement JWT-based authentication and middleware to secure routes.
Set up the MySQL database and write queries for storing and retrieving data.
Implement real-time chat functionality using Socket.io

## Database Design

The database is designed to store user information, research announcements, and collaboration requests.

## Tables: Some key tables include:

## Users: Stores user information such as name, email, password, and role.

## Announcements: Stores research opportunities and requests for collaborators.

## CollaboratorRequests: Stores requests from users to participate in research projects.

## Relationships: Use foreign keys to establish relationships between users and their announcements or collaborator requests.

Design the database schema for the Users, Announcements, and CollaboratorRequests tables.
Create SQL queries for interacting with the database (e.g., adding new users, posting new announcements).
Use an ORM (like Sequelize or TypeORM) if necessary for easier database interaction.
The database is structured to store the data related to users, announcements, collaboration requests, and messages.

Use an ORM (like Sequelize or TypeORM) if necessary for easier database interaction. 5. Real-Time Functionality (Socket.io)
The application includes real-time features such as chat and notifications. These are powered by Socket.io.

Chat Feature: Enables users to send and receive messages instantly.
Notifications: Notifies users when they receive a new collaborator request or message.
Steps:

## Set up Socket.io on both the frontend and backend.

Implement event listeners on the frontend for new messages and notifications.
Set up a backend listener to handle real-time events like new messages or collaborator request approvals.
